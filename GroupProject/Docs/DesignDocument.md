## 1 Design Considerations



### 1.1 Assumptions


We are creating an application that will enable the user to create , maintain and edit a grocery list. Assuming a User knows what products they want prior to shopping this would enable them to gain more utility from creating grocery lists.

The Application will have the following Dependencies:
- Toast: to alert the user when required.
- Android Studio: To compile the app since it's used to create the GUI.



### 1.2 Constraints

The User should be able to add any product they desire to the system. which means the size of the database must expand to accommodate user entries. 
### 1.3 System Environment

This application will be targeted at API Level 31 of Android. We are therefore targeting all phones that can run Android 12 and higher.
