# Project Plan



**Author**: Zachary Kleiman, Jatin K. Marwaha

## 1 Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Grocery Guru, the definitive Android Shopping List app.
This is a simple application which enables the user to create,edit and save shopping lists.

## 2 Process Description
### Inception  
During the inception period we delimited the project scope, assess the business case for the project and determined the actors(users) and the utility the system could do for them. we also established a tentative architecture and created a rough actionable plan for the product cycle.
#### Entrance criteria
A idea for a product
#### Exit Criteria
A actionable plan for delivering the product
### Elaboration  
During the elaboration period,we develop upon the actionable plan determined in the inception period. during this period we analyse the problem domain , establish the architectural foundation of the application, address the most critical uses cases and refine and revise all plans and estimates. 
#### Entrance criteria
a actionable plan
#### Exit Criteria
Design models,test cases, executable prototype alongside a revised actionable plan and a prototype
### Construction
During the construction period, we elaborate on the prototype to ensure all uses cases all realized and system tests are resulting in outcomes we expect. We also refine any prior documentation as needed to ensure the application runs optimally.
#### Entrance criteria
Design models,test cases, executable prototype alongside a revised actionable plan and a prototype
#### Exit Criteria
A user Manual , complete system test results, all use cases realized, and a mostly functioning application 
### Transition
During the Transition period, we deploy the application and fix any problems with the application we realize post-deployment. 
#### Entrance criteria
a functioning application 
#### Exit Criteria
A application that is well received and meets and hopefully excels past all requirements
